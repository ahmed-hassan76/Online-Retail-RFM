This project applies RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to the Online Retail dataset to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The goal is to identify valuable customer groups (e.g. champions, loyal, at-risk) and derive actionable marketing insights. The analysis is performed using Python (Pandas, Seaborn) in a Jupyter Notebook.
